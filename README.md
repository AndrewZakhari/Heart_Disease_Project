# Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction (PCA), feature selection, supervised learning (classification), unsupervised learning (clustering), hyperparameter tuning, and deployment via a Streamlit web UI.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space.
- **Feature Selection:** Employs techniques like Feature Importance, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Chi-Square tests.
- **Supervised Learning:** Trains and evaluates models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for heart disease classification.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Applies K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to discover hidden patterns.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes model performance using Grid Search and Random Search.
- **Model Export:** Saves the best performing model.
- **Web UI (Bonus):** Provides an interactive interface for real-time predictions using Streamlit.
- **Deployment (Bonus):** Instructions for deploying the Streamlit app using Ngrok.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andrewzakhari/Heart-Disease-Project.git
    cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    # On Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Notebooks

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the Jupyter Notebooks in sequence to execute the full pipeline:
1.  `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
2.  `02_pca_analysis.ipynb`
3.  `03_feature_selection.ipynb`
4.  `04_supervised_learning.ipynb`
5.  `05_unsupervised_learning.ipynb`
6.  `06_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`

Ensure the output of one notebook is available as input for the next (e.g., saving/loading processed data, models).

### Running the Streamlit UI

1.  Ensure the `models/final_model.pkl` file exists (generated by the pipeline).
2.  From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui/app.py
    ```
3.  The application will open in your default web browser.

### Deployment with Ngrok (Bonus)

Follow the instructions provided in `deployment/ngrok_setup.txt` to make the Streamlit app publicly accessible via a temporary URL.

## Dataset

The project uses the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset. The original data files are located in the `data/` directory. The main processed file used is typically `heart_disease.csv`.

## Results

The `results/` directory contains evaluation metrics and visualizations generated during the model training and evaluation phases.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
